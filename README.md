# HR Analytics Dashboard
This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of employee attrition data to support data-driven decision-making within HR departments. Key features include:

## Attrition Analysis: 
The dashboard visualizes attrition rates segmented by various dimensions including age group, gender, job role, education field, salary slab, and years at the company. This segmentation helps identify specific areas with higher attrition rates and understand the demographics and roles most affected.

## Interactive Visualizations: 
Advanced visualization tools such as pie charts, bar graphs, and line graphs are utilized to present complex data in an easily interpretable format. These interactive elements allow users to drill down into specific data points and view detailed insights, facilitating a deeper understanding of the attrition dynamics.

## Strategic Insights: 
The dashboard highlights critical trends and patterns. For instance, it reveals that laboratory technicians and employees with salaries up to '5k' have higher attrition rates. This information is crucial for HR teams to develop targeted retention strategies. The ability to analyze attrition across different age groups, job roles, and educational backgrounds aids in identifying and mitigating potential retention risks.
